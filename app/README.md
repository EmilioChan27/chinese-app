## Your personalized character database

- character uploader
  - you can upload take pictures of characters or write the characters yourself
  - you will have the option of either uploading the english definition or we can auto-generate it for you using an API or a dictionary that we store on-site
  - then when you do this it will automatically add the pinyin (will need to add some exceptions)
  - it will also add the english definition
    - this could be edited if you want
    - we can also automatically generate the pinyin from that (you can ofc correct it if you want (or even choose in cases where there is more than one option))
      - this will have to be hard-coded
  - there will also be a voice entry accompanying the word/phrase so that you can hear what it's supposed to sound like
